# Example ASTs

This directory contains example Core Erlang ASTs, in the syntax of the Rocq formalization.
All of the example programs were obtained from the [ErLLVM Benchmarking Suite](https://github.com/cstavr/erllvm-bench/tree/master) 
(from src/small in particular). The ASTs were obtained using the [pretty-printer](https://github.com/harp-project/erlang-semantics-testing/tree/frame-stack).

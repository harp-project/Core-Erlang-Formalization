-- isEmpty		: True if there are no processes to be scheduled, false otherwise
-- addPID		: Add a PID of a process to the schedule (not used directly in the interpreter)
-- removePID		: Remove a PID of a process from the schedule (used when processes terminate completely)
-- changeByAction	: Gets the PID of the process, a boolean whether the process is dead or not 
--			  (True if dead, False if alive), and the action that was performed on it.
--			  The PID is given, because tau and epsilon steps do not contain it. The internal
--			  changes to the schedule should be decided by the developer.
-- getOperation		: Gives back a new scheduler, along with a potential operation to be taken.
--			  If no steps can be taken (e.g. the scheduler is empty), Nothing should be given.
--			  Otherwise, a single PID can be given to perform a non-arrival action to the process
--			  assigned to it, or a pair of PIDs to make a signal arrive from a source to a destination.
--			  Note that signals in the Ether should be accounted for by the developer.
--			  With changeByAction, an ASend action means that a signal was sent to the Ether, but it
--			  has not arrived yet.

-- This is a variation of round-robin scheduling. Note that it differs from the classic
-- implementation in that new processes get inserted to a fixed point of the cycle.
-- The scheduler takes K non-arrival steps on a single process, then delivers all
-- signals in the Ether, and then moves on to the next process. If an ASpawn action
-- was taken, the new process' PID gets put into the cycle. If an ASend action was taken,
-- the (src, dst) pair is remembered.

-- The first Int is the original K, the secong Int is the amount of steps left from K,
-- [PID] is the list of PIDs to be scheduled, [(PID, PID)] is the source-destination
-- pair list of signals floating in the Ether, and the last Int is a pointer to the
-- list of PIDs in the scheduler.
